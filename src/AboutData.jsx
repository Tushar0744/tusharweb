      <h1>About Me </h1>
      <h5 className="my-3">
        I hold a B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from BITS
        Pilani, Goa Campus. I've gained valuable practical experience as a
        full-stack developer through internships and projects. I recently
        interned as a Software Development Intern at Rivigo, where I honed my
        skills in Java, Spring Boot, and utilizing databases like MySQL and
        Kubernetes for application deployment. Previously, I had the opportunity
        to intern as an SDE at Amazon, where I strengthened my foundation in
        programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with
        cloud technologies like Amazon DynamoDB and AWS. In my free time, I've
        participated in projects sponsored by the Department of Science and
        Technology and built personal projects using Python, React.js, Node.js,
        and Bootstrap. I'm proficient in a range of programming languages and
        technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, React.js,JavaScript,
        TypeScript, Python, AWS, Azure, C++, Git, Bootstrap, Amazon Dynamodb and Kubernetes.
        <br /> I'm always eager to learn and expand my skillset, and I'm excited
        to see what the future holds in the world of technology!
