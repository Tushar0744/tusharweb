      <h1>About Me </h1>
      <h5 className="my-3">
        I hold a B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from BITS
        Pilani, Goa Campus. I've gained valuable practical experience as a
        full-stack developer through internships and projects. I recently
        interned as a Software Development Intern at Rivigo, where I honed my
        skills in Java, Spring Boot, and utilizing databases like MySQL and
        Kubernetes for application deployment. Previously, I had the opportunity
        to intern as an SDE at Amazon, where I strengthened my foundation in
        programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with
        cloud technologies like Amazon DynamoDB and AWS. I've also worked on a sponsored project by BITS Pilani and built personal projects using Python, React.js, Node.js,
        and Bootstrap. I'm proficient in a range of programming languages and
        technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, React.js,JavaScript,
        TypeScript, Python, AWS, Azure, C++, Git, Bootstrap, Amazon Dynamodb and Kubernetes.
